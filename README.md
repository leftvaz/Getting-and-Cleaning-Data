# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data

This repo contains files for the assignment in the "Getting and Cleaning Data" course from Coursera.
The run_analysis.R script downloads the data and performs the neccessary transformations.
The tidy.txt file is the result of those transformations.
The CodeBook.md file describes the procedure.
